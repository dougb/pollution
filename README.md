### Notes from Mark ###

Hey there, Doug,

You're quite welcome for the pecans. I enjoyed making them almost as I enjoy eating and sharing them. :-) I also really enjoyed meeting you at lunch.

And thank you for your willingness to support the purchase of a few more sensors. That will help me move the project along quite nicely! Please make the check out to my company, "Blue Lens, LLC" at 6437 Landview Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15217.

The weather information that I use to predict stinky days (though I didn't predict today's massive stink!) comes from this website: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&w1=td&w2=wc&w3=sfcwind&w3u=1&w4=sky&w5=pop&w6=rh&w7=rain&w13=mhgt&w13u=0&w16u=1&w17u=1&AheadHour=0&Submit=Submit&FcstType=graphical&textField1=40.2923&textField2=-79.8817&site=all&unit=0&dd=&bw= . 

The tabular version (probably easier to scrape) is here: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?w0=t&w1=td&w2=wc&w3=sfcwind&w4=sky&w5=pop&w6=rh&w7=rain&w13=mhgt&AheadHour=0&Submit=Submit&&FcstType=digital&textField1=40.2923&textField2=-79.8817&site=all . 

I pay close attention to mixing height and wind direction, with more emphasis put on mixing height. Winds from the S/SE (going towards N/NW) are optimal for stink, it seems. And winds over 4-5mph can easily mess with the predictability of stink. The Smell PGH app/CREATE Lab at CMU can pull EPA sensor data (including wind direction) and I think they scrape it from this obscenely crude PDF source, updated hourly: http://www.achd.net/airqual/DailySummary.PDF . If you want to duplicate their work, I wouldn't stop you, but I could also discuss the possibility of having them let you pull from their scrape. Ultimately I think that your scrapes could help us establish an automated prediction algorithm-- at least a simple/crude one that we could refine over time. If it works well we might be able to hand the code over to the CREATE lab to integrate into their app. We may also learn other things that spark different approaches and/or local high school projects.

In all of this, please don't feel pressure to spend time or money. I'm happy to work collaborate with you as long as you're interested in helping and have the time to spare, and you certainly have some awesome skills that can move me along more quickly (and provide a valuable service to the community), but if you ever get to a point where it is just too much or you need to step away, I totally understand. Whatever you're moved to contribute will be greatly appreciated, and hopefully pave the way for Pittsburgh to meaningfully close the remaining gaps in our air quality efforts.

And we'll have to do lunch again before too too long. I took a very interesting air sample today during the stinky spell and hope to get it tested soon via the ACHD's fancy new mass spectrometer. Rest assured I'll share the results with you and Ryan!

Thanks again for your support in so many dimensions, and happy holidays!

All the best,
Mark

P.S. Nice job getting the Awair devices! Let me know when you set them up and we can hook you into the Slack group.
